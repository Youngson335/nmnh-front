      In 2015, Ivan Petrov and Alexander Sokolov found themselves working on
      separate freelance projects when their paths unexpectedly crossed during a
      tech conference in Moscow. Although they came from different programming
      backgrounds, they quickly discovered a mutual admiration for each other’s
      work. Ivan, an expert in mobile development with a deep understanding of
      user experience and design, complemented Alexander, a back-end and game
      development specialist known for his ability to build complex, scalable
      systems. After several discussions, they realized that their skill sets
      could be the perfect foundation for a new venture.

      applications that seamlessly blend technology and user experience. Both
      founders shared a passion for innovation, but they also understood the
      importance of a solid technical foundation. Ivan's experience in building
      mobile interfaces and user-centered design, combined with Alexander's
      proficiency in back-end development, gaming environments, and scalable

      ensured their mobile applications were efficient, visually engaging, and
      responsive, while Alexander’s mastery of Node.js, Python, and Java enabled
